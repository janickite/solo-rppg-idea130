Gameplay Example:
Let’s say you drew the following cards:
Appearance (Diamonds): Queen of Diamonds – Your beauty is unsettling, shifting with every glance. Others feel entranced but wary. You are both captivating and unnerving.
Personality (Hearts): Jack of Hearts – You are a master manipulator of emotions, but this leaves you feeling empty inside, unable to truly connect.
Cause (Clubs): 6 of Clubs – You were unwillingly sacrificed in an occult ritual, bound forever to the vampire world. This was not your choice, but now you must live with it.
Poetry (Spades): 10 of Spades – A deeply reflective poem about the duality of life and death, embracing immortality with a sense of existential dread.
